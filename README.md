# Angular-Fire

This project was generated with [yo angular generator] and customized as a base project.
It has preconfigured common functionality like Authentication, Authorization, etc.
In the future I might turn it into a Yo Generator.

## Build & development
you need to install Node.JS
Clone the repo and run `npm install` and `bower install`

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing
Running `grunt karma` will run Unit testing without opening the browser and show console output.
Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
